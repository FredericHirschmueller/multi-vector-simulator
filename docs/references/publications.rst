The MVS is currently under development in the H2020 research project `E-Land`. Still, there are already some references where additional information can be found regarding its intention, application, and method. More information about E-LAND can be found on the research project website: `E-LAND Horizon 2020. Novel solutions for decarbonized energy islands <https://elandh2020.eu/>`__

Projects using MVS
------------------

H2020 research project GRECO and tool pvcompare
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Andra Backhaus is using the MVS to simulate different energy systems and compare them to each other. He uses the MVS to see how energy systems planned on different levels influence the consumption and feedin on the national electricity grid. His research on "Analyzing the application of different energy cell sizes as an approach for the integration of decentralized renewable energy sources" is done in the context of the master Renewable Energy Engineering and Management at Albert-Ludwigs Universität Freiburg.

pvcompare
#########


- `_pvcompare_ <https://github.com/greco-project/pvcompare>`__ is a model for comparing the benefits of different PV technologies in local energy systems in different energy supply scenarios. It uses MVS for optimizing these energy systems and calculating specific KPIs.
- Functionalities of _pvcompare_ include among others the calculation of an area potential for PV on roof-tops and facades, heat and electricity demand profiles, PV feed-in time series for different technologies, temperature dependent COPs for heat pumps and pre-calculations for a stratified thermal storage.
- _pvcompare_ concentrates on the integration of PV technologies into local energy systems but could easily be enhanced to analyze other conversion technologies.
- Checkout the `documentation <https://pvcompare.readthedocs.io/en/latest>`__ to learn more about _pvcompare_.
