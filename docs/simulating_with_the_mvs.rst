=======================
Simulating with the MVS
=======================

In the MVS can perform a capacity as well as dispatch optimisation of a specific energy system. This means that both the capacity that is to be bought is optimised as well as the respective assets operation. To perform an energy system simulation, a multitude of input parameters needed, which are described in link. They include economic parameters, technological parameters and project settings. Together they define all aspects of the energy system to the simulated and optimised. With this, the MVS builds an energy system model which is translated to an equation system which is to be solved. The MVS tries to minimise the annual costs of demand supply.

In this section, we want to provide you with all information needed to run your own optimisations. First we will explain the two input types, json and csv, and then how to make an energy system model out of your real local energy system configuration.
